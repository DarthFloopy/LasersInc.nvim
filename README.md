A game for Vim, because why should Emacs have all the fun?

I was in the mood to play a game in my terminal the other day, only to realize
that all the fun games are inside Emacs. This project attempts to remedy this
horrific situation.

## Setup and usage
 - Dependencies:
   - `python3`
   - `pip3` packages: `pynvim`, `pygame`, `pyfxr`
 - Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and then run `nvim -u LasersInc.nvim`.
